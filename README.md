# Simple Console LMU Stats Viewer
Welcome to the simple stats viewer repo.
## What is this thing?
A simple console .net 8 app to give you a rough idea of your hopefully enjoyable time in the quite wonderful LMU racing sim.
## Why is this not a nice looking webapp?
I rather spend my free time racing the sim than building webapps, since I build those for a living. Also, webapps require me to at least "think" about a "design" üôÑ.
## Statistical caveats
Please note:
* Currently I take all the laps of a completed session (practice, qualifying or race) and deduct one. I will come up with a better way of deciding how many laps you actually completed when I have the time or feel like it.
* The game records no lap time of incomplete laps or invalidated laps, so I'm gonna have to maths my way to decide whether you completed a lap or not. Like I said, when I have the time or feel like it üòÅ.
